## When we hit https://www.techtonicgroup.com/ what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions.

When we hit the hypertext link, the operating system and browser find the link in the HTML of the page. It takes the uniform resource locator or URL from the link that indicates the webpage you want to view. First it breaks out the name of the website, then it uses the domain name system or DNS to lookup the IP address. Then the browser opens up a transmission control protocol or TCP connection to the website over IP. Which then asks to speak to the HTTP or HTTPS (for secure connection) server which then provides the website HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language.

## From start to finish how does that data reach you to be rendered in the browser?

Each computer/server has an IP address which is used to locate it on the web. Browsers use the TCP connection and IP addresses to route the information to the correct locations. So the users operating system and browser requests the information from the server. Then the TCP/IP transfer that information back to the clients browser, which renders the HTML, CSS and JavaScript associated with the webpage.

## What code is rendered in the browser?

The HTML, CSS and JavaScript associated with the webpage its trying to display.

## What is the server-side code’s main function?

Websites use server-side code to dynamically display different data when needed, generally pulled out of a database stored on a server and sent to the client to be displayed via some code (e.g. HTML and JavaScript). Perhaps the most significant benefit of server-side code is that it allows you to tailor website content for individual users. Dynamic sites can highlight content that is more relevant based on user preferences and habits. It can also make sites easier to use by storing personal preferences and information — for example reusing stored credit card details to streamline subsequent payments.

## What is the client-side code’s main function?

The Client sides code main function is handling the structure and presentation of the code pulled from the server.

## How many instances of the client-side assets (HTML, CSS, JS, Images, etc.) are created?

The total number needed to render the code properly.

## How many instances of the server-side code are available at any given time?

20 instances.

## What is runtime?

Runtime is the period of time when a program is running. It begins when a program is opened and ends with the program is quit or closed.

## How many instances of the databases connected to the server application are created?

The total amount of connections needed for databases.
