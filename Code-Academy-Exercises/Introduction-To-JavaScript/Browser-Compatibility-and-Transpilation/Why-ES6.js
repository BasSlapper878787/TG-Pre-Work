var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

var meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

var sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
var carbonara = "You can make carbonara with " + pasta + ", " + meat + ", " + " and a sauce made with " + sauce + ".";

// I learned about why the ES6 update was needed. Firstly it improved the similarity to other object-oriented programming languages. The new version also addressed some of the bugs in ES5. It also improved readability by using less characters to create the same functionality.
