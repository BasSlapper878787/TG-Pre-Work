// The loop below loops from 0 to 3. Edit it to loop backwards from 3 to 0
for (let counter = 3; counter >= 0; counter--){
  console.log(counter)
};

// I learned about looping in reverse in JavaScript, which allows you to log the loop staring with the last element in reverse sequential order to the first element.
