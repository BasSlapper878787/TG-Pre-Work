// Write your code below
for (let counter = 5; counter < 11; counter++) {

// I learned about the for loop in JavaScript. The typical for loop includes an iterator variable that usually appears in all three expressions. The iterator variable is initialized, checked against the stopping condition, and assigned a new value on each loop iteration. Iterator variables can have any name, but itâ€™s best practice to use a descriptive variable name.
