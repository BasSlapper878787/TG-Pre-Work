console.log(31)
console.log(2)

/* I learned about the keyword console in JavaScript, which refes to an object, a collection of data and actions, that we can use in our code. I also learned one action, or method, that is built into the console object is the .log() method. When we write console.log() what we put inside the parentheses will get printed, or logged, to the console. */
