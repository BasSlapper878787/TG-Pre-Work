<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>

  <div>
		<p>This paragraph is a child of the div element and a grandchild of the body element</p>
  </div>
</body>

<!-- I learned about the HTML structure of family trees. In this example the the h1 and div tags are nested within the body element and the p tags are nested within the div tag which makes it the child of the div element and granch child of the body element. -->
