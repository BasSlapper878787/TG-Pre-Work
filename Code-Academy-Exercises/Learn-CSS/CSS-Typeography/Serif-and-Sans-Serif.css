/* I learned about serif and sans-serif in CSS. Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of each letter. Examples include fonts like Times New Roman or Georgia, among others. Sans-serif fonts do not have extra details on the ends of each letter. Instead, letters have straight, flat edges, like Arial or Helvetica. */
